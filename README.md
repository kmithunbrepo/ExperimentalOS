# ExperimentalOS
This a lab work done during the Operating Systems Laboratory Course while pursuing MCA. A very intutive and practical approach to teach the students about the fundamental concepts of an operating system; how it is built from scratch and how it manages processes,memory, files and handles interrupt in a multiprogramming environment.

A short intro to eXpOS:
ExperimentalOS(eXpOS) is a tiny multiprogramming operating system built on a machine simulator called eXperimental String Machine(XSM, which consists of a processor, memory and disk). 
Built complete OS from Scratch: Implemented basic versions of process management, memory management, interrupt handling and other important concepts of OS.
